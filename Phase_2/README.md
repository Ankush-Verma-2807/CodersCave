# Mutual Fund ROI Analysis Dashboard

This dashboard has been created aiming to analyse different Mutual Fund Schemes and their Return on Investment (ROI). This project is created by me being a Business Analyst Intern as CodersCave.

### What is Mutual Funds?

Mutual Funds in India serve as popular investment vehicles, pooling funds from numerous investors to invest in diversified portfolios of stocks, bonds, and other securities. Investors benefit from professional fund management, risk diversification, and accessibility to various asset classes. 

The sector is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), ensuring transparency and investor protection. Mutual Funds offer flexibility, liquidity, and the potential for capital appreciation, making them a cornerstone of India's financial landscape.

## Details of the Project

This dashboard was created by web scraping data from various [Mutual Funds in India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravibarnawal/mutual-funds-india-detailed) which is downloaded by me from kaggle. The project can be useful for anyone interested in analyzing the performance of mutual funds in India or an investors in these schemes. Investors can use this Power_BI dashboard to study trends, compare different funds, and gain insights into the Indian mutual fund industry.

## More About Mutual Fund Ratios: 

- **Expense Ratio:**
An expense ratio is the cost of owning a mutual fund or ETF. Think of the expense ratio as the management fee paid to the fund company for the benefit of owning the fund. The expense ratio is measured as a percent of your investment in the fund. For example, a fund may charge 0.30 percent. That means youâ€™ll pay $30 per year for every $10,000 you have invested in that fund. Lower is better

- **Sortino Ratio:**
Sortino ratio is a statistical tool useful for evaluating the performance of mutual funds by considering the downward deviation. Therefore, the ratio is valuable for identifying the risk-adjusted returns from a specific investment scheme. It can help investors analyse the risk in a better way instead of simply concentrating on the returns as per total volatility.

Investors prefer investing in mutual funds with a higher return per unit of downside risk. Funds with a lower Sortino ratio will offer lower returns per unit of downside risk. Therefore, a higher Sortino ratio will offer better returns as compensation for the risk taken by investors.

- **Alpha:**
Alpha is commonly used to rank active mutual funds as well as all other types of investments. It is often represented as a single number (like +3.0 or -5.0), and this typically refers to a percentage measuring how the portfolio or fund performed compared to the referenced benchmark index (i.e., 3% better or 5% worse).

- **Standard Deviation:**
Standard deviation is a statistical tool that measures the deviation or dispersion of the data from the mean or average. When seen in mutual funds, it tells you how much the return from your mutual fund portfolio is straying from the expected return, based on the fund's historical performance.

- **Beta:**
Beta of a mutual fund scheme is the volatility of the scheme relative to its market benchmark. If beta of a scheme is more than 1, then scheme is more volatile than its benchmark. If beta is less than 1, then the scheme is less volatile than the benchmark

- **Sharp Ratio:**
Sharpe Ratio of a mutual fund reveals its potential risk-adjusted returns. The risk-adjusted returns are the returns earned by an investment over the returns generated by any risk-free asset such as a fixed deposit. However, higher returns indicate extra risk. Higher Sharpe Ratio means greater returns from an investment but with a higher risk level. Therefore, it justifies the underlying volatility of the funds. The investors aiming for higher returns will have to invest in funds with higher risk factors
